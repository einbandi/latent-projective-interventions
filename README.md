Projective Latent Interventions
==============================

Projective Latent Interventions are a technique to inform
the learning of neural network classifiers by
manually manipulating embedded latent spaces.

Paper preprint available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12902).

Requires [this PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/einbandi/ptsne-pytorch) of parametric t-SNE.

This repository contains application examples for the following datasets:

- MNIST
- [Morpho-MNIST](https://github.com/dccastro/Morpho-MNIST)
- CIFAR-10
- Fetal Ultrasound Images (Sononet classifier based on [code by Tianrui Liu](https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/trl15/spd_pytorch))
