Projective Latent Space Decluttering
==============================

Projective Latent Space Decluttering is a technique to introduce
constraints on the learning of neural network classifiers by
manually manipulating embedded latent spaces.

This repository contains application examples for the following datasets:

- MNIST
- [Morpho-MNIST](https://github.com/dccastro/Morpho-MNIST)
- CIFAR-10
- Fetal Ultrasound Images (Sononet classifier based on [code by Tianrui Liu](https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/trl15/spd_pytorch))
